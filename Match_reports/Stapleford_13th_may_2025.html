                                <h2> Fen Ditton CC vs Stapleford Phoenix CC, 13th May 2025 </h2>
                            <p> Sometimes it’s impossible to ignore the power behind a name. Phoenix—the bird that dies only to live again—and today’s match embodied that spirit perfectly, with momentum see‑sawing each side from losing to winning and back again. On a postcard‑sized ground in a gorgeous setting, Stapleford Phoenix took on Fen Ditton in the first Business League game of the year. What is the Business League, you ask? Great question. It isn’t a league, but it’s sort of a league, and presumably some form of business is involved somewhere. I have no idea, better ask Phil. </p>   
                            
							<h3>Fen Ditton educating the next generation</h3>
							<p>
							Losing the toss, Fen Ditton were sent in. Chetan and Pratham, born in the same town, raised in the same city, car‑pooled to the ground, opened together, made matching 30s and retired together. If that isn’t the beginning of a bromance destined for a straight‑to‑streaming film starring real‑life versions of Bert and Ernie, then what kind of life are we all leading? 
							</p>

							<p> Opening the bowling for Phoenix was young Jacob Frampton, somewhere in the 12‑to‑15 age bracket, backed up by seasoned veteran Fazel Lee. In addition to their elegant stroke‑play, Chetan and Pratham took time out of their busy schedules to give young Jacob a classroom session in cricket by launching his offerings for sixes and fours in every compass direction. The exact lesson learned is still debated, but I trust Jacob filed the experience under “growth” and may even pick up a cricket ball again.
							</p>
 
							<p>
							With both openers safely retired, we were cruising at close to 70 after eight overs—roughly a run a ball (remember: eight balls an over) and eyeing 140. Then the “simple harmonic” part of the title kicked in. Over the next 50 deliveries, bowled by Rohan and Jonathan, our middle order produced a meditative 25 runs, and by the end of the 14th the pendulum had swung back to Stapleford: Fen Ditton 94‑3, momentum firmly drunk at a pub, probably the same one Adam keeps sending selfies from. In the final over, I joined Nivin and unvieled a scientifically robust tactic: run on everything. Ball past a fielder? Run. Ball to a fielder? Run. Ball already in the keeper’s gloves? Why break habit? We scrambled to 105‑3 from 15 overs, underwhelming, but at least we looked busy. In the end, we had sixty‑three dot balls in a 120‑ball innings. Rahul Dravid would have been proud. 
							</p> 
 
							<h3>A class act of running between the wickets</h3>
							<p>
							Stapleford launched their chase with intent, 11 off the first over, 36 after four, and looked ready to stroll home. But the pendulum swung yet again: Chetan and Vishnu clawed things back, conceding only 23 in the next six overs. At 10 overs Stapleford were 59, still needing 47 from 40 balls and suddenly feeling the squeeze. Overs eleven and twelve leaked 8 and 11, trimming the ask to 28 from 24; the Phoenix was flaring up. Then Pratham produced a gem of a 13th over, one run, one wicket, tilting everything our way: 27 from 16. The 14th, bowled by yours truly (sigh), cost 16, and just like that it was 11 from the last eight. 
							</p>

							<p> Eleven needed off the final over and Pratham was, to use the technical term, shitting bricks. Hinks and Everson at the crease loudly and confidently proclaimed to run everything, and they did not dissapoint. Credit where it’s due: they were lightning‑quick, squeezing singles out of thin air, putting pressure on the fielders leading to misfields and more runs.  Last ball: two to win, one to tie. A run‑out felt like wishful thinking; we needed a catch or bowled. Pratham sent down a peach, the ball came flat to square leg, the fielder—alas, yours truly once again—went full stretch, got fingers under it, pictured the hero’s welcome… and let it dribble free. They jogged the first run but, praise be, never made the second. Was this our game to lose, or was a tie the best we could hope for?  
							</p>
								
							<p>
							Before I go, some memorable verbatim quotes from the match: 
							<ul>
								<li> Pratham: “Mitch was the reason I got that wicket last game—he was so encouraging.”<br>
									Mitch: “Nah, mate, I’m just a cunt.” </li>
								<li>
									Shikhar: “No need to put pads on; I doubt I’ll have to bat.”<br>
									Adam R. was bowled the very next ball. And Sameer—no, this is still not evidence that your superstitions work.
								</li>
								<li>
									Phil: “You retire on 31 runs.”<br>
									Adam: “That’s a weird number—why?”<br>
									Phil: “Apparently if someone clobbers five sixes, they deserve a crack at the sixth. That’s the logic.”
								  </li>
								</ul>
							</p>
