                                <h2> Fen Ditton CC vs Milton CC, 17th May 2025 </h2> <a href= "https://www.play-cricket.com/website/results/6997505"> Scorecard </a>

								<p> 
									Curses come in many flavours. You have the standard Pandora's box, basically the junk cupboard you swore you would clean last month, or the Ten Plagues of Egypt: flies, boils, inconvenient loss of first-borns, that sort of thing. Fen Ditton’s latest affliction is the Captain’s Curse: whatever the skipper wishes for, universe’s unseen fixture gremlins deliver the exact opposite.  Earlier this week James Wilson chirped, “We don’t have to drop loads of catches, bowl wides, or run out team-mates to make a fun report,” which I consider a flagrant slur on the match-reporting profession I really ought to unionise. Would today break the hex?  We were back on our own patch against sibling-club Milton CC, newly promoted alongside us and, annoyingly, serial winners of recent meetings between the two sides.

									The day started with AB losing the toss and being forced to bat first, which everyone agreed was clearly the best idea, mostly because we didn’t have a choice. Jonny, to his own astonishment, was told to open; few tentative pokes later he decided subtlety was overrated and began trading almost exclusively in fours and sixes. He and Matt hurtled to 70 in 12 overs before we mislaid Matt. Full credit to the grounds crew for an outfield slicker than black ice.  Jonny kept swinging, raced to 63, and we sat at 110 after 20 overs. In a touching show of sibling solidarity, Milton adopted our catching curse and shelled at least eight chances by my count. We were cruising toward 200, then somehow eked out five runs in the next six overs while donating two wickets probably for narrative balance. The lower order rescued us: first a 54-run stand between Jack and me, then the rest of the lineup channelled their inner IPL finisher to slap late boundaries and drag us to 211, a perfectly defendable total. Continuing the bromance from the last match, Pratham and Chetan joined forces again to lay out a very tasty tea, which, in Britain for reasons known only to Britain, is basically lunch.

									The Milton openers came out just as punchy as ours, planting Arko and Chetan to the rope at will. A classic “Yes-No-Sorry” mix-up soon sent one of them trudging back, and after ten overs they sat on a healthy 50-1. Cue Ian, who strolled in, throttled the run-rate, and nabbed a wicket, while Pratham at the other end snaffled two more to leave Milton wobbling on 82-4. Our fielding was the real difference: Matt channelled full Jonty Rhodes, ably backed by Manu and Ian, hoovering up anything that moved while the rest of us could’ve unfolded deckchairs. Spin clearly the order of the day, AB tossed himself the ball and bagged three; I pinched one as well, courtesy of another Matt special: a full dive taking it inches off the ground in a grab arguably prettier than his six in the league opener. Timed to perfection. Milton folded for 156, and in the end it all looked straightforward.

									In the end, everything James has ever wanted actually happened, we fielded brilliantly, bowled like saints, and batted like we’d rehearsed. Naturally, James wasn’t playing, so he missed the lot. AB did pocket the long-awaited win over Milton (revenge at last), but the Captain’s Curse seems to have switched hosts. His own spell featured two misfields, a dropped sitter, Ian stopping the ball with his neck, and a square-leg umpire who called a pretty dubious delivery a no-ball, an opinion that almost turned AB into a headline on the crime pages. So has the curse been broken or merely sub-let? And, more importantly, will James ever be <em>satisfied</em> by Fen Ditton?  </p>
