                                Stars die, and do so in a spectacular fashion, in a large fiery explosion known as a supernova. The leftover core after the explosion sometimes spins rapidly, firing particles into the surrounding chaos leading to the creation of some breathtaking scenes. One such image, nicknamed the Hand of God, released in 2014 by NASA, can be seen on the right. Notice how it’s slightly blurry. But worry not, because on 6th July 2025, in the quarter-final of the Junior Cup, Fen Ditton CC played Cherry Hinton CC and captured a much sharper version of this event. You're welcome, Astrophysics.

                                The days leading up to the match featured glorious sunshine, hot air, and skies so clear you could hear seagulls argue over the River Cam. Naturally, that meant it rained like hell on the actual match day. At 1pm, Paul sent out a message confidently announcing the match was on. Meanwhile, it was raining outside my house harder than it had all summer. Trusting Paul’s meteorological wisdom, we made our way to the ground, where it was still raining. In his defence, it wasn’t raining in Fen Ditton at the time he sent the message. The members of the other team mumbled in a different language (but understandable by me Ha!), that the umpire wanted to be paid and is making all of us play. Eventually the rain stopped, and a 15-over match began around 2:30pm, with us losing the toss and being politely forced to bat first.

                                The shortened format got into our heads. We collectively decided the best defence was to try and hit every ball into Cambridgeshire. This strategy did not hold up well under scrutiny, so we shifted to plan B: run as hard as possible, regardless of field placement or logic. Shockingly, this also failed. Four run-outs later, we found ourselves wobbling at 30 for 7 and looking like we might not breach 50. Jack Harding had other plans, scoring a crucial 32, and quick-fire cameos from Rob Winter and Aanish Ribeiro lifted us to 81 all out. Not a winning total, but at least a defendable one, provided we fielded like our lives depended on it.

                                While the match itself was important, some side stats deserve airtime. We had four ducks. The coveted Fen Ditton Duck Trophy is now a nine-way tie, with Adam Randall the latest inductee. His dismissal deserves a moment of appreciation. A short ball rose to hip height, caught the edge of his bat, ricocheted off his thigh, and rolled slowly onto the stumps. Hilarious at the time, though I saw Siraj get out the same way in the England Test, and I’m now less amused.

                                We started our defence in the best way imaginable: Chetan bowled a peach first ball to take a wicket. Rana Waleed, their number three batsmen however had other plans. He unleashed fury, scoring 20 out of his 43 in a single over. I did eventually bowl him, but the damage was done. Notably, he had been dropped by Jack Harding when he was on about 10. The aftermath of which is preserved in the image on the right. Fen Ditton’s very own Hand of God. Only with more bruising.
