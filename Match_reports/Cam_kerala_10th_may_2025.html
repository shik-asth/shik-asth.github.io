								<h1>A Catcher's Paradise </h1>

                                <h2> Fen Ditton CC vs Cam Kerala CC, 10th May 2025 </h2>
                            <p>The omens were glorious: blue skies, birdsong, and a venue so regal the locks alone had their own caddy. Trinity Hall’s sports ground boasts more gates than Buckingham Palace, none of which are labelled “Cricketers enter here.” Captain James Wilson eventually surfaced after an odyssey of wrong turns and padlocked portals, by which time a mildly kidnapped Arko had presided over the toss with all the democratic legitimacy of a banana republic. While we waited, Mitch filled the void with the heart‑warming tale of how he wooed his fiancée—a story he claims we’ll never hear again because this was “definitely” his last match. (See you coming Tuesday, Mitch.)</p>

                            <h3> Our Innings: 196 all out (38.4 ovs) </h3>
							<p> Sameer and Matt were volunteered to battle first on a strip sporting more bumps than Madingley Road. Sameer lasted roughly one over, wisely conserving energy for bowling rockets. Matt hung around long enough to belt the most photogenic six ever witnessed by human eyes before becoming the pitch’s second human sacrifice. Enter Adam and AB, who made haste like continental drift to shepherd us to the halfway mark (somewhere in the 60‑70s). Cam Kerala’s opening spell was all cunning and discipline: Noby reeled off five straight maidens, Shaji and Joseph squeezed harder than Ryanair’s legroom, and their fielders appealed for everything up to and including changes in the direction of the breeze. Square‑leg, apparently powered by Red Bull and delusion, vowed to give an LBW for deliveries pitched in the next postcode. </p>

                            <p> Adam, unfazed by the static‑hum of complaints, biffed a stylish fifty, whereupon Malaka ignoring the bumps, the bowlers and basic etiquette, flogged 53 off 45 balls. Cam Kerala’s tactical masterstroke? Shelving their best bowler to protect his bowling average—an act of self‑preservation so brazen it deserves its own wildlife documentary. When asked later why he never bowled his overs, he replied, “Have you ever seen 1‑for‑1 from six overs?". In his defence, I have not.</p>

                            <h3> Their Chase: 135 all out (37.4 ovs) </h3>
                                                  
                            <p> Sameer and Pratham opened our defence, ably "assisted" by an umpire who appeared to have left the Laws of Cricket in his other trousers. LBWs? Not this afternoon, sir. Edges to the keeper? Pure folklore.  Despite this, the pair scythed through both openers with ruthless efficiency. Cue the fielding exhibition nobody asked for: eight separate Dittonites dropped catches in a touching display of socialist equality.  By conservative estimate we conjured enough chances to bowl Cam Kerala out three times.</p>
                            
                            <p>
                            Yet wickets kept tumbling, mainly because Sameer (4/15) and AB (2/27) decided that, between the umpiring woes and our fielders’ ongoing cold war with the ball, it was safer simply to uproot stumps. Cam Kerala’s middle order dug in, swiping every delivery toward the rope on the assumption nobody would catch it—and, for a worryingly long stretch, they were right. Chief resistor Gisho John chiselled a defiant 44 (74 b), but the resistance ended in the 38<sup>th</sup> over with contributions to the wickets by Pratham, Shikhar and Arko.
                            </p>
                               
                            <p>
                             All out for 135, Cam Kerala finished 61 runs short, gifting Ditton victory and the comforting reminder that even our most ambitious bouts of self‑sabotage occasionally fall flat. Tune in next time for fresh and inventive ways we might shoot ourselves in the foot.
                            </p>
