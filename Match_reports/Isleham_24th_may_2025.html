								<h1> The Ripple Effect </h1>

                                <h2> Fen Ditton CC vs Isleham CC, 24th May 2025 </h2> <a href= "https://www.play-cricket.com/website/results/6997495"> Scorecard </a>

								<p>
									Gustave Le Bon coined the term "behavioral contagion" in 1895<sup><a href="Match_reports/Isleham_24th_may_2025.html#footnote-1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>, referring to the phenomenon where individuals in a group unconsciously mimic the actions of others, a ripple effect, if you will. Generally what is collectively perceived as a good (or bad) idea, is magnified by the rest of the group. Sitting on the sidelines scoring, as we’d chosen to bat first, I witnessed this unfold in real time. One by one, players started chipping in with suggestions for the match report providing brilliant insights, and hysterical takes on the game<sup><a href="Match_reports/Isleham_24th_may_2025.html#footnote-2" id="ref1">2</a></sup>. It made my job so easy that I confidently declared the match report had already been written, before the match had even ended. We will conveniently ignore the fact that it still took me over ten days to actually publish it, prompting Paul to ask, with his trademark dry delivery, “I thought the match report was already written?” 
								</p>

								<p> 
									The match was played at Isleham, a ground that seemed to share space with what I assume was the town’s central auditorium. It was lovely to see the locals out in force, enjoying the sun, the cricket, and the beer on tap. The ground featured two large sightscreens, which inspired Arko to bet that Sameer would insist on adjusting them. I thought they were fine and took the bet. Naturally, I lost. Sameer moved them three times. The aforementioned beer was promptly enjoyed by Adam R., who was immediately chastised by a few players. Personally, I disagreed. One pint in, Adam transforms into peak commentator mode. We need more of that.
								</p>

								<p>
									Arko and Jonny<sup><a href="Match_reports/Isleham_24th_may_2025.html#footnote-3">3</a></sup> opened the batting, and just as swiftly closed it. Arko was given LBW to a ball that hit him somewhere near the crotch, and he seemed quite willing to strip and provide evidence to the team. A possibilty of a charge of indecent exposure is probably why he did not go through with the show. As soon as the decision was given, Paul executed a table-smash that would’ve made the Hulk pause. I’ve genuinely never seen him that angry<sup><a href="Match_reports/Isleham_24th_may_2025.html#footnote-4">4</a></sup>, and he immediately went for a calming walk. This moment also gave rise to the “brace is an exoskeleton” jokes, courtesy of Jack, Bethan, and Adam R. While AB and Sameer rebuilt the innings, the mood on the sidelines turned... inclusive. Jokes flew, and we managed to tick off every major category of political incorrectness. In the middle of a fat joke, Adam R. broke a chair, claiming it was the burden of being a “thiccc boi.” On the field, debutant umpire Chetan added flair by dabbing when signalling wides. Back to the cricket: AB played a classy knock of 75 off 88, James smacked a rapid 52 off 35, and the rest chipped in to push us to a strong total of 243. Isleham’s bowlers were led by Solomon, with 2 for 35, while Luke, Jamie, Wade, and Jack each took one wicket.
								</p>
								    
								<p>  After a top-tier tea, Fen Ditton returned to doing what we’re best known for: bowling. If you expected me to say “fielding,” I recommend speaking to a professional.  Adam R., showing immense bravery (or perhaps poor judgment), donned the keeper’s pads but skipped the rest of the protective gear. By the end of the innings, he’d been struck on just about every body part available. The second innings was fairly uneventful. With a big total on the board, our bowlers chipped away steadily. There was a brief wobble during a 54-run partnership between Wade, who batted through for a solid 55* off 97, and Jack, who contributed 24 off 21. Sameer broke the stand, and we were back in control. Wickets were shared: James, AB, and Arko took two each; Sameer, Manu, and I claimed one apiece. Special mention to our fielders, who held onto five catches this time (Jack, Sameer, Arko, and Jonny). That alone might qualify as victory. A comfortable win in the end.

								Things I wanted to include but couldn’t find the right spot for: 
								<ul>
									<li> At one point during AB's batting, Adam R. pointed out that it looks like AB is bowling to AB (both the gentlemen looked extremely similar). </li>
									<li>Pratham telling James he wants to be the first bowling change. James came with a terse reply "No, I will decide."	</li>
									<li>Manu did a full backflip while fielding a ball. I don’t think it was intentional, but it was excellent.	</li>
									<li>Frustrated by some lazy fielding, James delivered this motivational gem: “Stop sucking and be better.” (Paraphrased, but not by much.)</li>
									<li>James wrote a summary for the game: "AB made it look easy, rest made it look like Sabina Park 98’. We dropped 8 chances but this time won. Oh and something about Plumbs etc.". Pretty accurate, and a true example of the ripple effect in action.</li>
								</ul>

										He coined it in his book "The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind," to explain behavioral patterns in crowds. I would recommend reading it, but it would be hollow advice because I have no idea what's in it. I have just read the wikipedia article. 
									</li>
									<li id="footnote-2">
										I will try to add as many as I can remember. Apologies if you thought you were funny, and I haven't added it here. It's not because I forgot, it was just not that funny. Just kidding, it's because I forgot. Reach out to me and I will add it.

										Jonny had asked me to highlight his name in the match report. So here it is, Jonny.  Also, he took a good catch. I hope you are happy now.  
									</li>
									<li id="footnote-4">
										This may sound odd considering the other match report also mentions Paul getting riled up, but chronologically, this happened first. I just didn’t write about it until now. Since then, further information has come to light, and I’ve been informed that the correct term is “disappointment,” not “anger.” I’m still undecided whether that’s better or worse for those on the receiving end.
