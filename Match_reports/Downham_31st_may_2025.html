                                Eight dropped catches? Come on people, hands are meant to hold on to the ball. <b>Inhale</b> I am not going to rant about the dropped catches, I am not going to rant about the dropped catches, I am not - <b>Exhale</b> There, now where was I? Oh yes, the match report.

                                Like Northern Ireland, and the rest of the UK, Fen Ditton and Little Downham share a past. In the last three encounters, we have never managed to put up a fighting total. The pitch is awkward to bat on, and the outfield makes you sprint like you’re running the relay. Anything hit along the carpet dies well short of the rope. May 2023, we were bowled out for 100 <a href="https://fenditton.play-cricket.com/website/results/5809005"> (Scorecard)</a>. July 2023, we only managed 96 <a href="https://fenditton.play-cricket.com/website/results/5809041"> (Scorecard)</a>, and in 2024, we scored 44 <sup><a href="Match_reports/Downham_31st_may_2025.html#footnote-1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>. An exponentially decreasing trend, nature's most beautiful curve. Will we break the trend today?

								The pitch looked familiar, so after winning the toss we batted. Familiar too was the start: 30-3 in ten overs, two wickets to sharp catches. Adam Jackson and Sameer Kesava steadied things with a 77-run stand, reaching 107 after 30. Sameer’s bid to accelerate went vertical, looking to reach long off and landed in mid-off’s hands, another excellent catch. Adam kept ticking, including a shoutout-worthy six over deep mid-wicket,the longest part of the ground, with just a flick of the wrist. How he managed to get so much power into that shot is beyond me. My guess is this is how he trained his wrists <a href="https://youtu.be/hHZvUeAdzeI?t=22" target="_blank">(watch this video)</a>. While he was on a roll slapping the bowlers around, Adam was given run out in a shocking decision by the square-leg umpire. Paul’s leg brace once again turned into a bionic leg, as he circled the field in 10 seconds flat to cool himself down. In that moment, I caught a glimpse of the Brits who managed to take over 30% of the world by the 1940s.  Later, the keeper confided in us that Adam was “so in,” but they appealed anyway just for the hell of it. The keeper was quite the <em>character</em>, and for the sake of friendliness, that’s all I’ll say. Our tail kept wagging, but nothing substantial came of it, and we added another 45 runs before being bowled out for 152 in 37.4 overs—six of those wickets falling to catches. Little Downham dropped nothing.

                                <p>An excellent tea setup later, points to Downham for the spread, we were back on the field. Defending 152 was going to be tough, and we knew the only way through was by backing up our bowlers. Hit the right length, stay tight, and the pitch would do the rest. Sameer and Arko opened beautifully, keeping the hosts stuck on 10 after 8 overs. The pressure carried forward, conceding just 10 more in the next 5. Then Arko held on to a catch off Manu’s bowling, and we had our breakthrough: 22 for 1 after 14.

                                The game shifted gears after that. Downham’s batters started swinging, and 45 runs came off the next 6 overs. At drinks, they were sitting pretty at 67 for 1. Things slowed down again, but only because one batter tried to sweep and hit the ball straight into his own face, retiring hurt. (Wear a helmet, kids.) The next 5 overs went for 25, and at the 25-over mark they were 92 for 3. The ask? 61 off 90 balls. Very gettable. Arko and Ian reeled things back with another tight spell, just about 10 runs off the next 5 overs, and the ask dropped to 50 off 60.
                                Another six overs later, they needed 27 off 24, with five wickets down. Still possible. But now David, their opener, and Rajbeer, their designated finisher, were both at the crease. Our best chance was wickets. And we dropped Rajbeer thrice. He kept trying to teach us lessons by hitting a boundary after every drop but I believe we refused to learn. David, who we dropped four times over the course of his innings, and who could barely breathe at this point, carried his bat to 55 off 108. Rajbeer finished with a quickfire 32 off 30. They chased it off the final ball.

                                Post-match discussion split along two lines: one camp focused on encouragement, the other on figuring out exactly where it went wrong. I firmly believe it was the dropped catches that cost us the game (hence the title of this report), while Sameer insists it was not batting the last 12 balls that did us in. Either way, the Little Downham curse lives on. And the question remains, does Paul wear a brace, or is it secretly a bionic leg? We’ll need another outrageous umpiring decision to gather more data.

                                    Luckily there is no scorecard for this match, because it was an absolute joke. The game finished an hour before tea. We were contemplating playing another match at some point.

                                    <li> An auction for a third/fourth hand bat was conducted at the start of the game.</li>
                                    <li> Jack was bitten by a spider. We do not know if it was a nickname of some sort.</li>
                                    <li> While I was scoring, someone said the bowler's name as White, and I asked "the normal white"? (As opposed to whyte)</li>
                                    <li> Bethan continued the tradition of roasting people.</li>
                                    <li> One bowler in the opposition was sort of chucking the bowl, Adam called him Chuck Norris.</li>
                                    <li> One member of the oppostion team asked "If its a tie, who wins?"</li>
