                                <h2> Fen Ditton CC vs Little Downham CC, 23rd August 2025 </h2>  
                                <a href= "https://fenditton.play-cricket.com/website/results/6997471"> Scorecard </a>
								<p> 
                                D-Day, for most of the world,refers to the brave Allied troops storming the beaches of Normandy. For eleven Fen Ditton cricketers (plus Sameer and Paul), D-Day was the day we faced Little Downham Cricket Club again. Now am I saying FDCC's players are as brave as the Allied troops? No. Was the day as important to us as D-Day was to the Allies? Also No. Does this analogy actually make any sense? Definitely Not. Will that stop me from using it? Absolutely Not. 
                                </p>
                                <p> 
                                Inspite of the extremely hilarous and quite frankly, nonsensical introduction to this match report, the match itself was crucial. The race to getting promoted has become quite exciting. Haddenham, with some controversy about their umpires, have secured a spot in Division one. The race for second, however, is still on, with Upwood and FDCC neck and neck. Mathematically, we have to win the remaining two matches, and Upwood have to lose atleast one for us to inch ahed. Chances of Upwood losing are slim considering they have to play Milton and Sutton, both of which are not having the greatest of the season. And yet, we persevere. Why? Because its D-day. Come on people keep up, stop asking dumb questions. 
								</p>
								<p> 
								Like I summarized in the previous match report about Little Downham (<a href="Match_reports/Downham_31st_may_2025.html">Catches Win Matches</a>)<sup><a href="Match_reports/Downham_31st_may_2025.html#footnote-1">1</a></sup>, we have never beaten them before, much to Sameer's annoyance. So much so that everyone who turned up to nets on the Thursday got a one-to-one game plan from him. On the day of the match, as usual, we lost the toss and were given the opportunity to bat first. The opening pair of Matt and Arko started strong. Arko then picked out deep square with pin-point accuracy, while Matt was bowled to what I think was a good delivery (It's been a week, I have forgotten). AB, Adam, and Jack kept the board ticking along but fell trying to accelerate leaving us stranded for 81-5 after 20 overs. There was a risk that we will not get enough runs on the board. Even worse, we might not bat the whole 40 overs and Sameer will scold us all like children. 
								</p>
								<p>
								However, for the next 15 overs we only lost 2 wickets, adding another 70 runs to the total. This was achieved by James,  motivated by a sense of duty, playing a captain's knock of 48. And despite one of us being slightly disabled and the other madly in love (or just mad; the jury's  out), Shikhar and Mitch provided something resembling support. A quick fire 12 by Nimal, and we were all wrapped by at 170, our highest score against Downham. 
								</p>

								<p>
									A lovely tea later (by James), and it was our time to bowl. And frankly, it could not have started off any better. James opened the bowling (again, motivated by a sense of duty?), and got the wicket sometime in the first over? Or perhaps the third. Either way he opened the account. Maybe. <sup><a href="Match_reports/Downham_31st_may_2025.html#footnote-2">2</a></sup> Arko followed this up with two wickets both caught by Nimal. And Matt, who I did not even know could bowl, knocked over the fourth with a well placed yorker. Downham were 17 for 4, and things seemed to be wrapping up. 
								</p>
								<p>Unfortunately, Ryan and Owen, famously known as the Duffield brothers <sup><a href="Match_reports/Downham_31st_may_2025.html#footnote-3">3</a></sup>, were stuck to the ground. Matt, Nimal, AB, Rob were thrown at them to break the partnership, to no avail. AB did manage to break Shane into two, and surprisingly his keeping becoming significantly better after that. I am not saying there is a correlation, but just to safe, this should become the pre-match routine. At the half-way mark, they needed close to 6 an over to achieve victory. Eventually, James brought on Shikhar, and well well well what do you know ... nothing changed. They were still welded to the crease. A few more quiet overs later, and a bad ball from Shikhar was dispatched to the boundary where James had a vision from our Lord and Saviour (insert whichever God you believe in) and decided that, instead of stopping it and saving three, he would let it go to the boundary. Pure genius, because the next ball, one of the brothers edged a ball to the keeper finally breaking the resistance. Masterplan. Inconceivable. 
							</p>
							<p>The next man was their main hitter Raj Singh. This was the man to get. And get him we did. AB, who had been bowling well all day, got an edge to the keeper. After this it was an easy walk to victory. James, Nimal and Shikhar cleaned the tail and we won by 44 runs. 
								</p>

								<p>
									In the end, one question remains. Does Mitch actually know the meaning of the words 'Last' and 'Match' when used in that order?

										Hold up. I just realised that my last league game was also against Little Downham. I haven't played a league match for 2 months? I want to file a formal complaint. Can I blame this on racism? Probably not, half the team is brown. Drat. 
									</li>
									<li id="footnote-2">
									It's not scored properly on play-cricket. Not my fault for thinking that Downham will score on the tablet. Who prefers the book over technology anyway?

									This is how they were referenced in the group chat by Paul, I think. And I thought it sounded like a cool name.
