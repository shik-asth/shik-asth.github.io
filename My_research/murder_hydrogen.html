								<h1>The murder of hydrogen</h1>
							</header>

							<p> At the beginning, no one really knows what happened. So, lets move forward in time a bit to a point where astronomers have a fairly good idea of distribution of matter in the Universe. This distribution turned out to be about 76% hydrogen and about 24% helium (by mass) with traces of heavier elements. So it turns out the early Universe was pretty much populated with hydrogen and helium. What happened to all this hydrogen?  </p>

<!-- Ideas 
1. Make a list of quotes that I like. Probably articles and artwork that I find interesting. What about board games? My notes.  Maybe write some articles on the things I find interesting. Should be a fun exercise.
